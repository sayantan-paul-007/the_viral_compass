Some changes to current module
- The video analysed will be saved as an instance of the analysis, akin to chatgpt or any chatbased llm
- Add some more features that was proposed my me at the earliest stage
- This module will allows user to upload videos of a specific limit and size
- The analysis report should be an engaging one with a combination of diagrams and figures
- In the previous model, the result was saved as md, now I will make the downloadable pdf format which will be downloadable 
- Login, logout via google auth
- If necessary, we can add an agent that will be the person who tells the analysis as a normal person (least optional)
